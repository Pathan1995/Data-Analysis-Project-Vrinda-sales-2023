# **Vrinda Sales Store 2023 Data Analysis **

## **Project Overview**
This project involves analyzing the sales data of Vrinda Sales Store for the year 2023. The goal is to identify key insights and actionable points that can help boost sales in 2024. The main purpose of this project is to demonstrate my learned skills in real-life scenarios, applying data cleaning, transformation, and analysis techniques to draw meaningful conclusions from raw data. The analysis includes data cleaning, transformation, and the creation of visualizations to showcase findings that can inform business decisions for the upcoming year.

## **Steps Taken**

### **1. Data Review and Cleaning**
- **Reviewed the dataset** to understand its structure and identify any inconsistencies.
- **Data cleaning**:
  - Removed wrongly entered data in the gender column (entries like "man" and "woman" were standardized to "men" and "women").
  - Handled other inconsistencies in the dataset to ensure clean and accurate data.

### **2. Data Transformation**
- **Added a new column for the month**: Used a text function to extract the month from the day-by-day data to make it easier to analyze sales trends over time.
- **Created a new "Age Group" column**: Used the `IF` function to categorize customers into age groups, which helped analyze purchasing power of age group based on gender.

### **3. Data Analysis**
- **Pivot Charts**: Used pivot charts to present findings on the dataset, including:
  - Top 5 states according to sales.
  - Dividing orders by status (e.g., orders, returned, refunded, cancelled).
  - Analyzing purchasing power by gender and age group.
  - Identify the top platforms (Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra) from which most orders came.
  - Analyzing monthly sales trends.

### **4. Visualization**
- **Dashboard Creation**: Built an interactive dashboard to display all the above analyses.
  - The dashboard includes all the key charts and is connected to **3 slicers** for dynamic filtering: Month, Channel (platform), and Category.

## **Tools & Technologies Used**
- **Microsoft Excel** (for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis)
- **Pivot Charts** (for data visualization)
